###A Basic Calculator
This code is for creating a sample calculator. 
The calculator can do 8 operations: addition (for 2 numbers and 3 numbers), subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorial, absolute value, and determine the number is odd or even.
The program will ask the user what kind of operation he/she wants to use, firstly. Then, the program reads the user’s input, and knows the user’s desired operation. After recognizing the user’s request, the program lets the user put the number/numbers for the operation. After the user enters the number/numbers, the program does the calculation, then gives the operation result to the user.
